# The Water Cycle

> _A newer version of the software may be available. See https://github.com/DOI-USGS/water-cycle/releases to view all releases._

This repo uses Vue3 to build a website that allows users to zoom and pan the USGS water cycle diagram. See more versions of the water cycle at: [https://usgs.gov/water-cycle](https://usgs.gov/water-cycle)

**The data visualization website can be viewed at [https://water.usgs.gov/vizlab/water-cycle](https://water.usgs.gov/vizlab/water-cycle).**

## Building the website locally

Clone the repo. In the directory, run `npm install` to install the required modules. Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev` to run locally from your browser.

To build the website locally you'll need `node.js` `v22.14.0` and `npm` `v10.9.2` or higher installed. To manage multiple versions of `npm`, you may [try using `nvm`](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-change-node-js-version-between-projects-using-nvm-3ad2416bda7e).
